## Welcome to the NH3API GitHub repository!
NH3API by void_17 is an open source C++17 library for modding Heroes of Might and Magic III. The library is primarly targeted at the latest version of the game(Complete edition) with [HD Mod by baratorch](https://sites.google.com/site/heroes3hd/ "HD Mod official page")

See our [wiki](https://github.com/void2012/NH3API/wiki) page for core guidelines on installing and usage of the library

## Rich game executable database covering most aspects of the game logic
The library is based on the void_17's IDA Database of the Windows x86 version of the Complete Edition executable.

More than 80% of the functions, variables and types names are from the original game code, [retrieved](https://github.com/void2012/HoMM3-Dreamcast-Dump) from the Dreamcast version of the game.

## Wide support of compilers

NH3API v1.2 supports three major compilers(including clang-cl in Visual Studio) and requires at least C++17 to work.
For C++98/11/14 support, see [v1.1 branch](https://github.com/void2012/NH3API/tree/v1.1)

## Easy to use
A single header for almost everything you need to mod the game

```cpp
#include <nh3api/core.hpp>
```

## Easy CMake integration
NH3API can be used without CMake(except for Era III), however the CMake integration is very straightforward. It takes only two CMake commands to include NH3API in your project

```cmake
add_subdirectory(nh3api)
target_link_libraries(MyProject PRIVATE nh3api)
```

## Era III modding platform support
NH3API supports Era III modding platform(just include `<nh3api/era/era.hpp>`) but requires CMake support. The integration is still pretty easy:

```cmake
SET(NH3API_CMAKE_USE_ERA ON CACHE BOOL "Build ERA support module")
add_subdirectory(nh3api)
target_link_libraries(NH3APIHelloWorld PRIVATE nh3api)
```

## Build
Simple Hello, World in a single dllmain.cpp file:
```cpp
#include <nh3api/core.hpp> // The directory of dllmain.cpp also contains the copy of this repository

// Display a "Hello, World!" dialog before the 3DO intro
void __stdcall HelloWorld(HiHook* hook, void* _this)
{
    NormalDialog("Hello, World!");
    THISCALL_1(void, hook->GetOriginalFunc(), _this);
}

extern "C" NH3API_DLLEXPORT
BOOL APIENTRY DllMain(HINSTANCE, DWORD fdwReason, LPVOID)
{
    if ( fdwReason == DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH  )
    {
        Patcher* patcher = GetPatcher();
        if ( patcher == nullptr )
            return false;
        PatcherInstance* instance = patcher->CreateInstance("HD.Plugin.NH3API.HelloWorld");
        if ( instance )
            instance->WriteHiHook(0x4EEE31, CALL_, EXTENDED_, THISCALL_, &HelloWorld);
        else
            return false;
    }
    return true;
}

```

Build the example:

MSVC:
```
cl /std:c++17 -I./nh3api /LD dllmain.cpp /Fe:hello-world.dll
```
GCC MinGW:
```
g++ -m32 -std=c++17 -I./nh3api -mdll -o hello-world.dll dllmain.cpp
```
Clang MinGW:
```
clang++ -m32 -std=c++17 -I./nh3api -mdll -o hello-world.dll dllmain.cpp
```

## Examples
See [Awesome-NH3API](https://github.com/void2012/Awesome-NH3API) for a curated list of plugins that use NH3API. Feel free to contribute and suggest your own plugin!

## Debugging
> [!NOTE]
> The NH3API contains a pretty printer for Visual Studio debugger. Add [nh3api_std.natvis](https://github.com/void2012/NH3API/blob/main/debugging/nh3api_std.natvis) to your C++ project in Visual Studio and enjoy the visualized debugging of NH3API containers which are fully binary compatible with the game.

## Acknowledgements
I want to thank AlexSpl and RoseKavalier for their enthusiasm and contribution to the HoMM III modding community.
This library also wouldn't be possible without the FatalistDC who published the Beta version of the Dreamcast port which contained the debugging information
