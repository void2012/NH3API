## Welcome to the NH3API GitHub repository!
NH3API by void_17 is an open source C++ library for modding Heroes of Might and Magic III. The library is primarly targeted at the latest version of the game(Complete edition) with [HD Mod by baratorch](https://sites.google.com/site/heroes3hd/ "HD Mod official page")

See our [wiki](https://github.com/void2012/NH3API/wiki) page for core guidelines on installing and usage of the library

## Rich game executable database covering most aspects of the game logic
The library is based on the void_17's IDA Database of the Windows x86 version of the Complete Edition executable.

More than 80% of the functions, variables and types names are from the original game code, [retrieved](https://github.com/void2012/HoMM3-Dreamcast-Dump) from the Dreamcast version of the game.

## Wide support of compilers 

NH3API supports three most popular compilers and has C++98 support for older versions Visual Studio.

## Easy to use
A single header for almost everything you need to mod the game

```cpp
#include <nh3api/core.hpp>
```

## Easy CMake integration
NH3API can be very easily used in your CMake C++ project, it takes only two CMake commands to include NH3API in your project

```cmake
add_subdirectory(nh3api)
target_link_libraries(MyProject PRIVATE nh3api)
```

> [!TIP]
> If your compiler supports C++17, you should use inline mode of the library which requires no CMake integration and compiling the static library. 
> Define the NH3API_FLAG_INLINE_HEADERS globally and you can use NH3API without any build system! It makes things way faster.

## Build
Simple Hello, World in a single dllmain.cpp file. The directory with dllmain.cpp also contains the copy of this repository,
```cpp
#include <nh3api/core.hpp>

// Display a "Hello, World!" dialog before the 3DO intro
void __stdcall HelloWorld(HiHook* hook, void* _this)
{
    NormalDialog("Hello, World!");
    THISCALL_1(void, hook->GetOriginalFunc(), _this);
}

extern "C" NH3API_DLLEXPORT
BOOL APIENTRY DllMain(HINSTANCE hinstDLL, DWORD fdwReason, LPVOID lpvReserved)
{
    if ( fdwReason == DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH  )
    {
        Patcher* patcher = GetPatcher();
        if ( patcher == nullptr )
            return false;
        PatcherInstance* instance = patcher->CreateInstance("HD.Plugin.NH3API.HelloWorld");
        if ( instance )
            instance->WriteHiHook(0x4EEE31, CALL_, EXTENDED_, THISCALL_, &HelloWorld);
        else
            return false;
    }
    return true;
}
```

Build with CMake and Ninja:
```shell
cmake -G "Ninja" -B bin  && cmake --build bin
```

Build without CMake(requries C++17):

MSVC:
```shell
cl.exe /std:c++17 -I./nh3api -DNH3API_FLAG_INLINE_HEADERS /LD dllmain.cpp /Fe:hello-world-nh3api.dll
```
GCC MinGW:
```shell
g++ -m32 -std=c++17 -I./nh3api -DNH3API_FLAG_INLINE_HEADERS -mdll -o hello-world-nh3api.dll dllmain.cpp
```
Clang MinGW:
```
clang++ -m32 -std=c++17 -I./nh3api -DNH3API_FLAG_INLINE_HEADERS -mdll -o hello-world-nh3api.dll dllmain.cpp
```

## Debugging
> [!NOTE]  
> The NH3API contains a pretty printer for Visual Studio debugger. Add [nh3api_std.natvis](https://github.com/void2012/NH3API/blob/main/debugging/nh3api_std.natvis) to your C++ project in Visual Studio and enjoy the visualized debugging of NH3API containers which are fully binary compatible with the game.

## Acknowledgements
I want to thank AlexSpl and RoseKavalier for their enthusiasm and contribution to the HoMM III modding community.
This library also wouldn't be possible without the FatalistDC who published the Beta version of the Dreamcast port which contained the debugging information
